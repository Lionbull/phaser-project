# phaser-project
Phaser project for "Introduction to Web Programming"

User must have Phaser 3 and any live server tool installed. Phaser 3 can be installed using npm in the project folder. For live server I have been using “Live Server” extension for Visual Studio Code. When you have all the required tools installed, just run the “index.html” file with live server and the game will start.
